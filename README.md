# Springboard-Section-23.2-SQLAlchemy-Associations-Exercise-Pt2  
This is one of the coding exercises for students on the Software Engineering course from [Springboard](www.springboard.com)  
It follows on from Section 23.1 Pt1  
This assignment covers the use of SQL Alchemy, Python, Jinja, HTML, and a PostgreSQL database  
The models.py file has been updated to include a Post model and thus a posts table  (title, content, created_at)  
A foreign key in the posts table links it with the users table  
In addition to that in Pt1, functionality has been added to allow posts for users to be viewed (summary and detail), added and deleted  
There is no authentication or authorization  
Again, some testing of routes has been included
